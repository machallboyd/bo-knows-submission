## A modest Chrome extension for Palace Beast users who like to submit stories

Are you a Palace Beast who wants to submit stories to the front page but don't want to spend entire seconds copying and pasting things back and forth between tabs? Do you hate pressing one one extra button to autofill information? Then we've got something for you.

### How to Use:

Once installed, you'll see a new icon in the upper right of your browser. Go to the news story you want to submit and click the new icon. A new Palace Beast submit page tab will open and autofill with the url, headline and image url.

Want to include some summary text too? Highlight the paragraphs you want to include first, then click the button. Anything you highlighted will be copied in to the summary field.
