## A modest Chrome extension for Bo News users who like to submit stories

Are you a Bo News user who wants to submit stories to the front page but don't want to spend entire seconds copying and pasting things back and forth between tabs? Do you hate trying to hunt for the article image url hidden behind a bunch of horseshit? Wish you could just press a button and have everything done for you? If so, we've got a Chrome extension for you.

###Testing the beta:

For instructions on installing an unpacked extension, see here: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24577024/install-chrome-extension-not-in-the-store>. You'll need to download all the files and put them in a directory, enable developer mode, and select the directory.

Once installed, you'll see a new icon in the upper right of your browser. Go to the news story you want to submit and click the new icon. A new Bo submit page tab will open and autofill with the url, headline and image url.

Want to include some summary text too? Highlight the paragraphs you want to include first, then click the button. Anything you highlighted will be copied in to the summary field.
